    <h2>So, why learn Japanese?</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Make new <b>friends!</b></li><p>Japan is country with 125,738,636 people. That's a lot of new to talk to and (potentially) make new friends! But, how will you communicate with them? 
        Japanese people do learn English in school but, just like us, they don't have much opputunity to actually use what they know with English speakers.</p>
      <li>Experience a new culture.</li><p>Japan has a long and interesting culture. Being isolated from the rest of the world for hundreds of years...</p>
      <li>Understand a diverse array of media from Japan.</li><p>Japan is home to many famous companies like Sony and Nintendo, 
        which famously make many games excusivly in Japanese that are never translated into English. This also applies to Japan's extensive array of anime and manga. 
        Think of all the stories and experiences you could be missing out on! So why wait? Let's start with the basics.</p>
